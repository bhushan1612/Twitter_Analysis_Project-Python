Twitter Stock Market Analysis(Latest Updated Datasets)

Twitter is one of the popular social media applications where people share what they feel in a limited number of words. Twitter is popular but not in the stock market. As Twitter is being delisted from the New York stock exchange, letâ€™s analyze the complete timeline of Twitter in the stock market. 

Task 1:-
	Twitter started its journey in the stock market in 2013. So to analyze the complete timeline of Twitter in the stock market, we need the stock price data of Twitter from 2013 to 2022.

1)	Read the data and display the first 100 rows from the data
2)	Give the column insights 
3)	Check whether this dataset contains any null values or not if it is there then remove the null values from it 
4)	Find the statistical description of the data.
5)	Find the missing values in the data 


Task 2:-
6)	Give me the Z-test O/R T-test over High, low, and close columns and see if the null hypothesis gets rejected or accepted
7)	By using ANOVA find the Fvalue and Pvalue from the data and see its Acceptance and rejection of the Null hypothesis.
8)	Check if the data is dependent or independent by using the chi-square method.
9)	Calculate the Z-score for the given data and by using the Gaussian distribution approach (Optional)
10)	Write the insights which you have got  from the above  tests 



Task 3:-
11)	Show the Twitter stock prices over the years  and give a conclusion.
12)	Now compare the close vs date column for Twitter prices over the years.
13)	Assign buttons to control time periods.  Add the  buttons to analyze the stock prices of Twitter in different time periods:
14)	Give the complete timeline of Twitter in the stock market. (Line Graph)
15)	Show the quartile, inter-quartile Lower, Median, and Upper Quartile on the given dataset  you can use any three columns for that (Box-Plot)
16)	Give the insights for the above analysis and make a word cloud for that analysis.
17)	Create a Dashboard from the above statements by using power BI or Tableau or Python and present it to the Client.



Final task:-
Create a Summary Conclusion for the Entire Analysis and show the insights to the client
